# Data Preparation
## Initial Folder References
```{r folders}
sibfldnm    <- 'Data'
parent      <- dirname(getwd())
sibling     <- file.path(parent,sibfldnm)
```

## Load Data
```{r load_data}
fn <- "beaches_data.csv"
beach_data <- read_csv(file.path(sibling, fn))
```

```{r}
names(beach_data)
```

##  Add a "Beach" Identifier
```{r add_beach}
fn = "beach_locations.csv"
beach_lookup = read_csv(file.path(sibling, fn),
                        col_types = cols(
                          Town = col_character(),
                          Beach_Name = col_character(),
                          SamplePoint = col_character(),
                          Latitude = col_double(),
                          Longitude = col_double()
                        )) %>%
  select(-Latitude, -Longitude)

beach_data <- beach_data %>%
  mutate(Beach = beach_lookup$Beach_Name[match(SiteCode, 
                                               beach_lookup$SamplePoint)])
```

## Add a "Day of the Week" Identifier
We may need this to help evaluate whether samples are "normal" samples or "storm"
samples.

```{r add_day}
beach_data <- beach_data %>%
  mutate(Weekday = weekdays(sdate)) %>%
  relocate(Weekday, .after = Month)
```

## Normal and Conditional Samples
The Beaches program principally collects samples from each beach on specific
days of the week.  Samples collected on other days may be "non-standard" 
samples. For example, protocol after a beach closure is to test a few days
later to see if levels of bacteria have returned to safe levels.  We should not 
expect such conditional samples to have the same distribution of bacteria levels
as normal samples.

Unfortunately, records are not entirely reliable on this matter, so the best
we can do is figure out if samples were collected on a "normal" day of the week.

We look at Crosstabs by year to figure out the pattern.
```{r table_by_day}
dow <- xtabs(~Year + Weekday + Beach , data = beach_data)
dow
```

### Add The Indicator for "Normal" Samples
We create a `FALSE` variable, and then go through site by site, flipping the 
value to `TRUE` when appropriate.  This code may not be appropriate for
future data sets, as it is tailored to the exceptions in the current record.
```{r conditional_samples}
beach_data <- beach_data %>%
  mutate(normal_flag = FALSE,
         normal_flag = if_else(Beach == 'Broad Cove Reserve' & 
                                Weekday == 'Wednesday',
                                TRUE, normal_flag),
         normal_flag = if_else(Beach == 'East End Beach' & 
                                Year < 2016 &
                                Weekday %in% c('Monday', 'Wednesday', 'Friday'),
                                TRUE, normal_flag),
         normal_flag = if_else(Beach == 'East End Beach' & 
                                Year >= 2016 &
                                Weekday %in% c('Tuesday', 'Thursday'),
                                TRUE, normal_flag),
          # The only "extras" at Mackerel Cove are on Thursday
         normal_flag = if_else(Beach == 'Mackerel Cove' & 
                                Weekday !=  'Thursday',   
                                TRUE, normal_flag),
          # At Mitchell Field, we just pick out the two "extras"
         normal_flag = if_else(Beach == 'Mitchell Field Beach' & 
                               (Year == 2018 & Weekday !=  'Thursday') |  
                                 (Year == 2019 & Weekday != 'Wednesday'),
                                TRUE, normal_flag),
        # The only "extras" at Stover's Point are on Thursday
         normal_flag = if_else(Beach == 'Stovers Point Preserve' & 
                                Weekday !=  'Thursday',   
                                TRUE, normal_flag),
         normal_flag = if_else(Beach == 'Willard Beach' & 
                               Weekday %in% c('Monday', 'Wednesday'),
                                TRUE, normal_flag),
        # At Winslow, it's not clear if any of the samples were exceptional
        # samples, so we treat them all as regular samples.
         normal_flag = if_else(Beach == 'Winslow Park', 
                                TRUE, normal_flag)) %>%
    relocate(normal_flag, .after = Weekday)
```

## Add Maximum Likelihood Estimate for Non-detects
This uses our LCensMeans package, and estimates a maximum likelihood estimate
of the expected value of the (unobserved) left censored values.  It relies
on several assumption that are questionable for these data.  Principally,
the LCensMeans package assumes data are lognormally distributed.  These data
are far more heavily skewed and heavy-tailed than that. Still, this approach
is arguably better than using the detection limit or half the detection limit. 

```{r handle_non-detects}
beach_data <- beach_data %>%
mutate(Bacteria2 = sub_cmeans(Bacteria, Censored_Flag) )
```

## Calculate Exceedences
```{r calculate_exceedences}
beach_data <- beach_data %>%
  mutate(Exceeds = Bacteria > 104) %>%
  relocate(Exceeds, .after = Censored_Flag)
```

# Preliminary Graphics
## Histograms
```{r histograms, fig.width = 7}
ggplot(beach_data, aes(Bacteria, fill =Censored_Flag)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  scale_fill_manual(values = cbep_colors()) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 104, lty = 3) +
  scale_x_log10() +
  facet_wrap(~Beach, scale = 'free_y') +

  theme_cbep(base_size = 10)
```

The East End Beach observations at a different dilution are curious, as they
do not turn up anywhere else.

## Pareto distribution?
A Pareto distribution should turn up as more or less a straight line on
a log-log plot of the histogram.  The following suggests we have something
akin to a Pareto distribution, although perhaps zero-inflated.

```{r is_it_pareto}
ggplot(beach_data, aes(Bacteria2, fill =Censored_Flag)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  scale_fill_manual(values = cbep_colors()) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 104, lty = 3) +
  scale_x_log10() +
  scale_y_log10() +

  theme_cbep(base_size = 10)

```
So, other than the superabundance of observations at the lower detection limits,
and perhaps a concentration of values at the maximum observed value (right
censored?), this shows every sign of being close to a Pareto distribution.

We are fitting a Pareto distribution with minimum value `location = 0`, and 
using  data that has been corrected for left censoring.  Results are similar
for other data sets, but the selection of minimum value has a large effect on 
fit.

```{r pareto_fit}
paretofit = vglm(Bacteria2~ 1, paretoII(location = 0) , data = beach_data)
parms <- exp(coef(paretofit))
names(parms) <- c('Scale', 'Shape')
parms
#predict(paretofit, newdata = data.frame(x = 1))
```

```{r plot_pareto_fit}
ggplot(beach_data, aes(Bacteria2, fill = Censored_Flag)) +
  geom_freqpoly() +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 104, lty = 3) +
  scale_x_log10() +
  scale_y_log10() +

  theme_cbep(base_size = 10) +
  
  geom_function(fun = dparetoII,
                 args = list(location = 0,
                             scale = parms[[1]],
                             shape = parms[[2]]),
                 color = 'red')
```

## Temporal Plots
```{r time_plots, fig.width = 7}
ggplot(beach_data, aes(Year, Bacteria, color = normal_flag)) +
  geom_jitter(alpha = 0.5) +
  #geom_smooth() +
  scale_fill_manual(values = cbep_colors()) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 104, lty = 3) +
  facet_wrap(~SiteCode, scale = 'free_y') +
  scale_y_log10() +

  theme_cbep(base_size = 10)
```

Note the early data from EEB-01 with a lower reported Reporting Limit.

## Annual Frequency of Exceedences
```{r annual_exceedences, fig.width = 7}
ggplot(beach_data, aes(Year, as.numeric(Exceeds), group = Year)) +
  stat_summary(geom = 'col', fun = mean, color = 'gray50') +
  facet_wrap(~SiteCode, scale = 'fixed') +
  theme_cbep(base_size = 10) + 
  ylab('Proportion Exceeding Standard')
```

It is not obvious that the observations collected outside of the normal schedule
are any different.  Quick graphical analysis and modeling suggests it is not,
but because of the highly skewed nature of the data, that conclusion may not be
entirely reliable. The available models are not likely very sensitive to the
small differences we would expect.

Without strong evidence that we need to retain the  sample types in our models, 
we will omit them.

# Recent Status
```{r recent_data}
recent_data <- beach_data %>%
  filter(Year > 2015)

recent_data %>%
  group_by(Beach) %>%
  summarize( years = length(unique(Year)),
             median_Bacteria = median(Bacteria2, na.rm = TRUE),
             gmean_bacteria = exp(mean(log(Bacteria2),nas.rm = TRUE)),
             mean_Bacteria = mean(Bacteria2, na.rm = TRUE),
             p90_Bacteria = quantile(Bacteria2, .9),
             n = sum(! is.na(Bacteria2)),
             n_exceeds = sum(Exceeds, na.rm = TRUE),
             p_exceeds = n_exceeds / n)

```

Note that the median Bacteria for pretty much all of these stations is at or
below the lower detection limit. (That is possible because we have replaced
non-detects by an estimate of the conditional mean expected for unobserved
censored values).  That means the data is at or below the detection 
limits more than 50% of the time.

```{r summaries}
cat('Omitting non-detects\n')
summary(recent_data$Enterococci)
cat('\nNon-detects at Detection Limit\n')
summary(recent_data$Bacteria)
cat('\nNon-detects at maximum likelihood estimator\n')
summary(recent_data$Bacteria2)
cat('\nGeometric Mean\n')
exp(mean(log(recent_data$Bacteria2)))
cat('\n\nProbability of Violating Standards\n')
sum(recent_data$Exceeds) / sum(! is.na(recent_data$Exceeds))
```

## Analysis of Bacteria MPN Data
### Distributions
```{r plot_cdf}
df <- data.frame(left  = if_else(beach_data$Censored_Flag, NA_real_, 
                             beach_data$Bacteria),
             right = beach_data$Bacteria)

plotdistcens(df)
```

```{r cullen_frey}
tmp <- beach_data%>%
  filter(! is.na(Bacteria)) %>%
  pull(Bacteria) %>%
descdist()
```

So, the distribution of bacteria levels is more skewed than a gamma distribution.

It falls within the range of skewness and kurtosis of a beta distribution, but 
the beta distribution is bounded by zero and one.  So, the only reasonable 
choice (?) for a GLM is likely the inverse Gaussian family. 

We look at a log-transformed version of the data.

```{r cullen_frey_2}
tmp <- beach_data%>%
  filter(! is.na(Bacteria)) %>%
  pull(Bacteria) %>%
  log() %>%
descdist()
```

So log transformed data are not that far removed from a lognormal distribution.
We may be able to model this with a gamma or inverse Gaussian GLM.

### Simple Log Linear Model
Although we think a simple linear model is inappropriate given the highly skewed 
data, we look at it anyway as a starting point for analysis.

```{r plot_simple_lm}
test_lm <- lm(log(Bacteria) ~ Beach, data = recent_data)
plot(test_lm)
```
The model fails to address extreme values.

```{r}
(emms <- emmeans(test_lm, "Beach", type = 'response'))
```

```{r plot_lm_emms}
plot(emms) + 
  xlab('Enteroccocci\n(MPN / 100 ml)') +
  coord_flip() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.25))
```

```{r pwpp_lm}
pwpp(emms)
```

So only two pairwise comparisons are meaningful -- both contrasting our 
cleanest beach -- Harpswell's Stover's Point Beach -- with our two with the 
highest bacteria levels -- Willard Beach and Harpswell's Mackerel Cove Beach.

We should be aware, however, that this model was not especially a good one, so
we should take any such comparisons with a grain of salt.

#### Log Linear Model Checking "Extra" Samples
Although we think a simple linear model is probably inappropriate given the
highly skewed data, we look at it anyway as a starting point.

```{r check_conditional}
test_lm_2 <- lm(log(Bacteria) ~ Beach * normal_flag, data = recent_data)
anova(test_lm_2)
```
That suggests the "special" sampling days are not significantly different from 
the normal sampling days, somewhat contrary to expectations.

### GLM Analysis
We explored Gamma GLMs and inverse Gaussian GLMs using several link functions, 
(1/mu^2, inverse, identity).  Results are qualitatively similar.  The inverse
Gaussian models perform relatively poorly (based on model diagnostic plots), so 
we only show results of the Gamma GLM.

#### Gamma GLM
```{r gamma_glm}
gamma_glm <- glm(log(Bacteria) ~ Beach, 
                family = Gamma(), 
                data = recent_data)
```

```{r diagnostics_gamma_glm}
boot::glm.diag.plots(gamma_glm)
```

```{r}
(emms <- emmeans(gamma_glm, "Beach", type = 'response'))
```

The rank order of predicted values and their approximate values all appear more
or less appropriate, but we have little confidence in the model, and its
strongest result is that sites do not differ in average bacteria levels.

```{r plot_gamma_glm_emms}
plot(emms) + 
  xlab('Enteroccocci\n(MPN / 100 ml)') +
  coord_flip() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 30, size = 10, hjust = 1)) +
  ylab('')
```

```{r pwpp_gamma_glm}
pwpp(emmeans(gamma_glm, "Beach"))
```

#### Pareto GLM
The Gamma GLM does not address these highly skewed data adequately.
Further models would need to focus on zero inflated models or Pareto 
distributed errors, or both.  Our efforts to use Pareto models in VGAM
have been frustrated by the package's relative complexity.

We ran into estimation problems when we included the Stover's Point Preserve
site in the model, apparently because the data is almost all non-detects.

```{r pareto_glm}
pareto_vglm <- vglm(Bacteria2 ~ Beach, 
                    paretoII, data = recent_data, 
                    subset = Beach != 'Stovers Point Preserve',
                    maxit = 50)
anova.vglm(pareto_vglm)  # ANOVA returns an error
```

So that shows we do have differences among sites.  It's hard to isolate those 
differences, however.

```{r}
summary(pareto_vglm)
```

None of the individual parameter are significant, so comparison to the base
case (Willard Beach) is not where the differences lie.  Unfortunately, 
`emmeans()` does not support `vglm` models.  We use predict instead. Since we 
are not certain of how to evaluate significance of pairwise comparisons of
the Pareto parameters, we provide only qualitative interpretation.

```{r pareto_results}
sites<- tibble(Beach = unique(recent_data$Beach)) %>%
  filter(Beach != 'Stovers Point Preserve')
p <- predict(pareto_vglm, newdata = sites, se = TRUE)

ptab = cbind(p$fitted.values, p$se.fit)
rownames(ptab) <-  sites$Beach
colnames(ptab) = c('log_Scale', 'log_Shape', 'log_Scale_SD', 'log_Shape_SD')
ptab
```
The call to `predict()` returns estimates of model parameters, which
here include not a mean or standard deviation, but (log transformed) estimates
of the parameters of an implied Pareto distribution for each beach.

Parameters are generally similar for all sites, except:  
1.  Willard Beach has a low (negative log) shape value.  That implies a very
    heavy "tail" at that site.   
2.  Mackerel Cove has a high scale parameter and the highest shape parameter
    (by a small, statistically uncertain amount).  That implies a relatively
    high level of bacteria, but lower frequency of very high observations than 
    that might suggest. 

The negative loglink(shape) parameter for Willard Beach suggests a shape
parameter less than 1, which implies a Pareto distribution with such heavy tails
as to have no defined variance.  That appears likely to be a meaningful
difference from most other beaches, based on eyeing the standard errors.

##### Moments of the Pareto Distribution
We can estimate moments from the parameters. Wikipedia reports the moments of 
(this variant of) the Pareto Distribution as:

$$ E(x) = \frac{\sigma}{\alpha - 1} + \mu  \quad \alpha > 1$$

Where:  
*  $\sigma$ is the SCALE parameter  
*  $\alpha$ is the SHAPE parameter  
*  $\mu$ is the Location parameter (minimum possible value, here zero)  
      
So the mean goes UP with SCALE and DOWN with SHAPE.

Variance (for $\mu = 0$) is:
$$ Var(x) = \frac{\sigma^2 \alpha}{(\alpha-1)^2(\alpha-2)}  \quad \alpha > 2$$
For $\alpha < 2$, it is infinite.  For $\alpha < 1$ it is undefined. 

So, variance also tends to go UP with SCALE and DOWN with SHAPE.

##### Pareto Interpretation
We can conclude:  
*  Willard Beach has moderate levels over all, but a high probability of very
   high observations.
*  Mackerel Cove has relatively high overall levels, but chances of extreme
   value as at that site are lower than expected based on that average.

### Non-parametric Tests
We proceed to a nonparametric analysis. This is useful for a one way analysis, 
but does not lend itself to testing more complex models.

```{r kruskal_test}
kruskal.test(Bacteria2 ~ Beach, data = recent_data)
```

Although the Kruskal-Wallis test is not strictly a comparison of medians, it's 
close, so we can look at medians. 

```{r summary_again}
recent_data %>%
  group_by(Beach) %>%
  summarize(Median = median(Bacteria2),
            iqr = IQR(Bacteria2),
            p90 = quantile(Bacteria2, .9))
```

These data include our (simulated, thus random) estimates of expected values of
censored values.  Thus any values under 10 imply that the median observation is
really just a non-detect.  Minor differences in those medians are due to
random variation in simulations.  For  those sites, a comparison of the 
interquartile ranges and p90 scores are most appropriate.

```{r wilcox}
pairwise.wilcox.test(recent_data$Bacteria2, recent_data$Beach,
                 p.adjust.method = "holm")
```

### Conclusions
Linear models and Generalized Linear Models were not very useful.  Each failed
to address extreme values with any authority. The Pareto model provided insight
into occurrence of extreme values (although without clear support for 
hypothesis tests), and the nonparametric methods provide a more robust analysis.

Luckily, conclusions of all analyses are generally in agreement with regard to 
qualitative findings.

Harpswell's Stover's Point Preserve has the lowest bacteria levels of any of
Casco Bay's regularly monitored beaches.  Based on the nonparametric analysis,
its bacteria level is lower than that of all sites except Mitchell Field
Beach. (p values less than 0.1; if you use a p < 0.05 standard, the
difference with Broad Cove becomes questionable.)

Two other sites with similar median values -- Broad Cove Reserve and
Mitchell Field Beach -- showed slightly higher probability of elevated 
bacteria levels, but given the limited data, such differences are not robust.

Our two most urban beaches, East End Beach and Willard Beach East End Beach,
while showing slightly higher median values, also have many observations where
bacteria were not detected, so observed differences with other beaches are not
robust.

The highest bacteria levels were observed at Mackerel Cove, but differences
are only statistically robust when compared to the cleanest Casco Bay beaches.  

The Pareto analysis suggests an important distinction between the two beaches
the highest levels of bacteria -- Mackerel Cove and Willard Beach.  While 
elevated levels are more abundant at Mackerel Cove, when things are bad at 
Willard Beach, they have sometimes been exceptionally high.

## Analyzing Exceedences of Standards
An alternative modeling approach emphasizes the frequency of violations of water
quality standards. Given the highly skewed nature of data on bacteria counts, this
transforms a difficult quantitative analysis into a simpler binomial analysis.

We can instead model probability that a site exceeds applicable water quality 
standards.

### Binomial Model
```{r binomial_model}
exceeds_glm <- glm(Exceeds ~ Beach, family = 'binomial', 
                   data = recent_data)
anova(exceeds_glm, test = 'LRT')
```

Sites do not differ in the probability of violating instantaneous water quality
standards.

```{r}
summary(exceeds_glm)

```

Note the exceptionally high standard error for Stover's Point.  No sample from
that site has failed water quality criteria, so the estimation is unstable.

We repeat the analysis, omitting that site, to improve model performance and
check if results are changed in any way.

```{r binomial_alt_model}
exceeds_glm_2<- glm(Exceeds ~ Beach, family = 'binomial',  
                    data = recent_data,
                    subset = Beach != 'HARP-1')
anova(exceeds_glm_2, test = 'LRT')
```

That does not alter our conclusions.

# Trend Analysis
We only have long term data from two beaches -- East end and Willard.

```{r trend_data}
trend_data <- beach_data %>%
  filter(grepl('WIL', SiteCode) | SiteCode == 'EEB-01') %>%
  filter(! is.na(Bacteria2))
```

## Initial Graphic
```{r first_trend_graphic, fig.width = 5, fig.height = 8}
ggplot(trend_data, aes(x = Year, y = Bacteria2, color = Beach)) +
  geom_jitter(alpha = 1, height = 0.025, width = 0.2) +
  scale_y_log10() +
  
  xlab('') +
  ylab('Enterococci (MPN)') +
  
  theme_cbep(base_size = 12) +
  scale_color_manual(values = cbep_colors()) +
  theme(legend.position = 'bottom') +
  facet_wrap(~Beach, nrow = 2)
```

We have several problems with trend analysis here.  The first stems from the 
early data from East End Beach, which has a lower detection limit than later
data.  Since a high proportion of observations are non-detects, our estimate 
of trends may be dominated by detection limits. We could take three approaches:

1.  Collapse all low values (below 10) to a pseudo non-detect category;  
2.  Construct a model that explicitly addresses the probability of a
    non-detect over time;  
3.  Just drop the earliest data.  

Number 3 is most straight forward.  The lower detection limits were used prior 
to 2005.

The second is that we have no recent data from two of the three Willard Beach
monitoring locations.  It MAY be appropriate to collapse that data, but we 
can not be sure without conducting principled analysis.  Also, since 
observations were collected at all three locations at Willard Beach on the same 
days, they are correlated, and we have to model them as such.  Given the 
difficulty we have had identifying models that handle the highly skewed 
bacteria data adequately, We are not confident that complex models will
address those correlations adequately.

## Restricted Data
We restrict attention only to WIL-02 at Willard Beach.

```{r filter_trend_data}
trend_data <- beach_data %>%
  filter(SiteCode == 'WIL-02' | SiteCode == 'EEB-01') %>%
  filter(! is.na(Bacteria2)) %>%
  filter(SiteCode == 'EEB-01' | Year > 2004) %>%    # Remove Willard early data
  filter(Reporting_Limit > 5 | is.na(Reporting_Limit)) # Remove data with low RL
```

## Log Linear Model
```{r loglinear_trend}
trend_lm <- lm(log(Bacteria2) ~ Beach * Year, data = trend_data)
anova(trend_lm)
```

```{r}
summary(trend_lm)
```

```{r}
year_trends <- emtrends(trend_lm, ~ Beach, var = "Year")
year_trends
```

## Gamma GLM
```{r gamma_trend_glm}
trend_glm <- glm(log(Bacteria2) ~ Beach * Year, 
                 family = Gamma(),
                 data = trend_data)
anova(trend_glm, test = 'LRT')
```

```{r}
summary(trend_glm)
```

```{r}
year_trends <- emtrends(trend_glm, ~ Beach, var = "Year")
year_trends
```

Note that the linear predictor here is the inverse, which means positive 
predictors suggest the inverse is increasing, so the response must be 
declining, although not significantly so here.

So, our conclusions are again robust -- we do not see evidence of changes in
levels of bacteria observed at either beach.

## Binomial GLM
```{r binomial_trend_glm}
exceeds_trend_glm <- glm(Exceeds ~ Beach * Year, family = 'binomial', 
                   data = trend_data)
anova(exceeds_trend_glm, test = 'LRT')
```

We again see no evidence for a trend.

## Conclusions
We have no evidence for trends over the full record, but we should report that
result with appropriate humility.  We noted some apparently statistically
significant trends when analyzing different subsets of the data. Those may 
result from inadvertent "cherry picking" of the data, or because of short-term 
observable trends.  Also, we lack good, consistently controlled predictors for
the entire period of record, as some methods changed
